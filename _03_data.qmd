# Data

Our data consist of a table of strategic interventions (that are commonly employed in Oregon and elsewhere in the United States) and a dataset of Oregon county-level housing, demographic, and economic data between January 2013 and December 2022.  Below, we detail how we got the data, how it was cleaned, and how it was stored.  We also document potential biases we have introduced in the collection and processing of this data.

### Identification of Strategies
Given the ultimate goal of this project to identify strategies that can help balance demand with the rising cost of housing, 
we began by conducting a comprehensive review of current strategies addressing housing affordability. This review aimed to 
identify the fundamental objectives of these strategies, such as increasing housing inventory, stabilizing rental prices, 
and enhancing accessibility for low-income households.  While all the strategies sought to bring more affordable housing, some of the strategies would do so by
encouraging more building and thereby increasing the number of housing units.  The result of this review is a list of strategies, their respective goal, and
the primary category they fall into is detailed in the following table.

### Data Sources and Acquisition

#### Identifying and Collecting Housing, Demographic, and Economic Indicators

We initially set out to find individual house sale data for as many years as possible.  We also wanted to collect: 

* historical land prices - land price plays a big factor in the ultimate affordability of a house,
* construction costs - also play a big role in what a builder will charge for a home, 
* time to construct a house - this is important for 2 major reasons 1) the longer the builder needs to hold on to the land, the more expensive the construction becomes and 2) being able to build a home more quickly brings more inventory to the market sooner, helping with demand
* median income for a county - to be able to assess the affordability of a housing or rent payment over time
* number of housing units - to have an indication of the housing level and assess its relationship to median sale price in an area


In this section, we address the significant lack of publicly available
housing data, which has posed considerable challenges for our research.
Although we successfully integrated ten years of Redfin data with
demographic and economic indicators, there remain several critical data
points we were unable to obtain. Notably, data extending beyond ten
years did not exist.  The intersection of Redfin data which
in ernest in 2013 with the Census ACS 5-year estimates, which only go as far as the end of 2022
limited the timeline of our data.  Also missing from the public domain were a number of interesting data points, such as 
historical land prices, construction costs, and timelines for
housing development.  This data could be present behind paywalls like 
ATTOM (https://www.attomdata.com/) and Zillow Research Data (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), but we were unable 
to identify the full complement of features they might have available.  Both sites wanted to schedule a sales meeting
to discuss a contract before discussing what data we might be able to obtain, so we decided to find what we could in the
public domain.  The Oregon State website was also a disappointing dead-end, only providing data on a dashboard or through PDF format
in increments that did not work for this project, being either in large jumps (10 year increments) or not many years available.  The data we could find 
on the state site could be also be obtained in other ways, such as through the U.S. Census.
These gaps represent missed opportunities that could have enhanced the comprehensiveness of our
dataset. 

#### Housing Data - Redfin Data Center

Redfin provides a comprehensive dataset accessible through its data
center, offering both graphical representations and downloadable files.
The dataset spans from 2012 to the present and allows for geographic
filtering specific to Oregon counties, although 2013 data was much more complete. 
We extracted data for all available years in June, 2024, encompassing all property types, and used raw values
rather than year-over-year comparisons or seasonally adjusted figures.  We found missing data, for some sparsely
populated counties.  Sometimes the entire month row would be missing and other times one or more features were missing and indicated with NA.
House sales are rare for some counties and filling in 0 for missing variables made sense while not trying to add
additional rows was most appropriate.

#### Demographic Data

The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, conducted by the
U.S. Census Bureau, offer extensive demographic data on various aspects
of life in U.S. communities. From this source, we obtained county-level
estimates for median income, rental vacancy rates, property taxes, and
the number of housing units per year. Historical population estimates
for each county were sourced from the Portland State University
Population Research Center. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) user website provided yearly 50th percentile rent
estimates for each county. For our analysis, we utilized the 2-bedroom
rental estimates for each county and year.  We found no missing data in the U.S. Census
5-year estimate tables, HUD data, or the Portland State University's Population Research Center.

#### Economic Indicator

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis offers a robust collection of
economic data, from which we obtained historical national data on
30-year mortgage rates. While county or state-level mortgage rate data
was unavailable, we posited that state-level figures would approximate
the national averages, with similar trends observable across the data.  As this 
assumption could lead to a false conclusion if Oregon's monthly average rate was very 
different, we only used this piece of data to help view general trends in house payment 
affordability over time.

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning

Several sources, such as census.gov, provide APIs for data access.
However, we found it more practical to use their table explorer to
download CSV files. The sheer volume of variables on census.gov
necessitates an advanced search mechanism, including an AI-assisted
search tool that offers intelligent data suggestions based on user
queries. Once the desired table configuration is achieved, the tool can
generate an API call for future data retrieval. Although this feature is
beneficial for obtaining up-to-date data, it was not essential for our
current project.

We encountered a variety of data formats from different sources, which
necessitated significant data cleaning and preparation. A notable
challenge was managing data provided as separate files for each year,
resulting in an extensive number of files for our ten-year study period.
To streamline this process, we concatenated these files, which involved
transposing tables and manual data manipulation. We later automated this
process with a Python script to make it more efficient.

Standardizing county names and removing extraneous characters, such as
dollar signs from prices, were additional tasks required to harmonize
the dataset. Despite these challenges, the data was generally
well-structured. In the end, we were able to go from disparate data
sources into a cohesive set of CSVs that could be imported into a Postgres 
database.

### Data Storage

These datasets were imported into temporary tables using an SQL script,
facilitating the creation of a comprehensive database through joins
based on county and year.



The final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is
illustrated in the figure below.


![Entity Relationship Diagram](images/data/erd-updated.png){#fig-erd}


The capstone redfin and mortgage tables were straight imports from the cleaned CSVs.
The capstone income_population_housingunits_rent table was created with a series of left joins
starting with the income temporary table, then individually joining the population, 
housingunits, rent, rental_vacancy, and property_tax tables on county and year.

*  redfin table had a date format of yyyy-mm-dd (dates were always first of each month)
*  mortgage table had a date format of yyyy-mm-dd (dates were always first of each month)
*  income_population_housingunits_rent had a date format of yyyy

By joining our resulting tables, were able to use this database to create the initial dataset, 
output to a CSV file, to use for our analysis. The resulting dataset was created by joining the tables seen in the ERD.
Starting with the redfin table, we joined the mortgage data on date the columns.  The income_population_housingunits_rent
table was then right joined by year (extracting year from the redfin table date and comparing it to the income_population_housingunits_rent table).



### Feature Engineering

We were able to obtain a number of features related to affordability,
including current rental prices, national monthly mortgage rates,
median_sales_prices. These allowed us to create new variables
specifically targeted to affordability. All of these operations were performed
on the dataset defined above in Python and the resulting features were added to the Pandas dataframe to continue
the analysis.

###### **Reconciling Monthly and Yearly Data**

We noticed odd things when we plotted monthly vs yearly data in our
scatter plot graphs. Our data took on clumped column shapes. And it did
not seem representative of what happens in reality. A county's median
income does not suddently increase from one year to the next, for
example. Many of these variables will be different over smaller
increments of time. While consulting with our project statistician, Hank
Ibser, he suggested that smoothing the transition of the yearly
variables by taking the average change and cumulatively increasing (or
decreasing) the feature amount over the number of months of county data
would be a better way to deal with the features than to leave large
jumps from year to year. This left the question of what to do with the
last year of data, since we do not have numbers beyond 2022. We decided
to average all the previous deltas and apply that as our step up or
down, then proceeded to multiply that by the number of months of data we
had and apply the incremental steps to the original rows. We smoothed
out the transitions in this way for the following variables:
`median_income`, `population`, `num_housing_units`, `median_rent_2bdrm`,
and `rental_vacancy`.

Example plots of before and after:

::: {#fig-smoothed layout-ncol=2}

![Before Smoothing](images/before_smoothing.png){#fig-before_smoothing}

![After Smoothing](images/after_smoothing.png){#fig-after_smoothing}

Feature Engineering: Variable Smoothing
:::

These feature transitions were smoothed using the following formula:

For each county, sorted by ascending date, for each year except the last represented:

$$ monthly\_avg = \frac{next\_year\_value - current\_year\_value}{n} $$

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ smoothed\_month\_of\_year = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i\times{(monthly\_avg)} + month\_of\_year $$
:::

For each county, sorted by ascending date, last year of rows:

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ smoothed\_month\_of\_year = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i\times{(avg\_mc)} + month\_of\_year $$
:::

Where:<br> 
<i>n</i> = number of rows of data for the county in a year<br> 
<i>next\_year\_value</i> = the first value of the next year for the feature<br> 
<i>current\_year\_value</i>= the first value of the current year for the feature<br> 
<i>monthly\_avg</i> = average monthly change for the year<br>
<i>avg\_mc</i> = average monthly change for all previous years<br>

###### **Monthly Housing Payment**: `monthly_housing_payment`

We then created a variable to hold the median monthly mortgage payment,
using the following formula (Mortgage Payment Calculator - NerdWallet, 2023) and
validated against the online calculator at the same site:

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ M = .8\times\frac{I(1 + I)^N }{(1 + I)^N − 1} $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>M</i> = `monthly_housing_payment`<br> <i>P</i> =
`median_sale_price`<br> <i>I</i> = `monthly_avg_mortgage_rate`<br>
<i>N</i> = 360 (the number of total payments over 30 years)<br>

We made this calculation based on a 20% down payment and a 30-year fixed
term. This is a big assumption, but gives us a baseline to look at
affordability.

###### **Monthly Median Income**: `monthly_median_income`

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ mmi = \frac{mi}{12} $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>mmi</i> = `monthly_median_income`<br> <i>mi</i> =
`median_income`<br>

###### **Monthly Affordable Housing Payment**: `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`

This feature holds the maximum housing payment considered affordable,
based on the HUD's affordability threshold of 30%.

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ mahp = .3 \times mmi $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>mahp</i> = `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`<br>
<i>mmi</i> = `median_income`<br>

### Resultant Shape of Dataset Used for Analysis

We gathered data and engineered features for different uses that will be detailed in the [Analysis] section below, but
we did not use every variable gathered for that analysis.  For understanding of our resultant dataset going forward, we
used the following features.  The resulting analysis dataset consists of 4050 rows and contains data collected from January 2013 to December 2022.

### Data Ethics Statement

This dataset consists of aggregated time series data from various sources, and we acknowledge several ethical considerations and potential biases that users should be aware of:

* Data Aggregation: While aggregation protects individual privacy, it may obscure nuances and potentially introduce biases.
* Missing Data: Our dataset contains gaps due to incomplete reporting or the unavailability of data. We've documented the dataset suffering from incomplete data and discussed how we deal with the situations that arise.
* Availability Bias: Some data sources were inaccessible behind paywalls, which may have introduced an availability bias. Our dataset might over-represent information from sources with more resources or those willing to share data openly. We've attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a diverse range of sources where possible.
* Preprocessing Bias: The data cleaning and normalization procedures we've employed, while necessary for analysis, may have inadvertently emphasized certain patterns or diminished others. We've documented all preprocessing steps to ensure transparency, but we encourage users to critically evaluate how these procedures might impact their specific use cases.
* Time Series Considerations: As a time series dataset, there are potential issues with seasonal biases, trend-related challenges, and autocorrelation. We've documented the full time range of the data and any known external factors that may have influenced the data during specific periods.
* Estimated Data:  Estimations in data are inherently biased.  We have done the best we could with our conclusions and limitations to take into account that much of our data comes from an uncertain collection.
