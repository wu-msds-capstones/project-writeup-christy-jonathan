# Data

Our data consist of a table of strategic interventions commonly employed in Oregon and elsewhere in the United States, alongside a dataset of Oregon county-level housing, demographic, and economic data spanning from January 2013 and December 2022.  Below, we detail the process of data acquisition, cleaning, and storage. Additionally, we document potential biases that may have been introducted during the collection and processing of this data.

### Identification of Strategies
Given the ultimate goal of this project-to identify strategies that can help balance demand with the rising cost of housing-we began by conducting a comprehensive review of current strategies addressing housing affordability. This review aimed to 
identify the fundamental objectives of these strategies, such as increasing housing inventory, stabilizing rental prices, 
and enhancing accessibility for low-income households.  While all the strategies designed to increase affordable housing, some focus specifically on 
encouraging new construction to increase the number of housing units.  The outcome of this review is a list of strategies, their respective goal, and
the primary category they fall into is detailed in the following table.

### Data Sources and Acquisition

#### Identifying and Collecting Housing, Demographic, and Economic Indicators

Our initial goal was to gather individual house sale data for as many years as possible.  Additionally, We aimed to collect the following data: 

* Historical land prices: Land price is a crucial factor in determing the ultimate affordability of a house.
* Construction costs: These costs significantly influence what a builder will charge for a home. 
* Time to construct a house: This is important for two major reasons: 1) the longer the builder needs to hold on to the land, the more expensive the construction becomes and 2) Faster construction increases housing inventory, which helps meet demand. 
* Median income for a county: This allows us to asses the affordability of housing or rent payments over time.
* Number of housing units: This provides an indication of housing availability and its relationship to median sale prices in an area.


In this section, we address the significant lack of publicly available
housing data, which has posed considerable challenges for our research.
Although we successfully integrated ten years of Redfin data with
demographic and economic indicators, several critical data
points remain unavailable. Notably, we could not find data extending beyond ten
years.  The overlap of Redfin data, which
begins in ernest in 2013 with the Census ACS 5-year estimates, which only go as far as the end of 2022, limited the timeline of our analysis.  Furthermore, we were unable to access certain data points from public domain, such as historical land prices, construction costs, and timelines for
housing development.  While such data might exist behind paywalls like 
ATTOM (https://www.attomdata.com/) and Zillow Research Data (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), but we could not fully explore these options. Both sites required scheduling a sales meeting to discuss a contract before revealing the available data, so we chose to focus on what was asccessible in the public domain.  The Oregon State website was also a disappointing dead-end, only providing data on a dashboard or through PDF format
in increments that did not work for this project, being either in large increments (10 year gaps) or covered too few years.  We found that the data provided by the state could also be also be obtained in other sources, such as through the U.S. Census.
These gaps in data availability present missed opportunities that could have enhanced the comprehensiveness of our dataset. 

#### Housing Data - Redfin Data Center

Redfin offers a comprehensive dataset accessible through its Data
Center, providing both graphical representations and downloadable files.
The dataset covers the period from 2012 to the present, with geographic
filtering available for Oregon counties. However, we found that the data from 2013 onwards was more complete and reliable.

In June 2024, we extracted data for all available years, including all property types. We opted to use raw values instead of year-over-year comparisons or seasonally adjusted figures.  During the extraction process, we encountered missing data for some sparsely populated counties.  In some cases, entire rows for specific months were absent, while in others, certain features were missing and marked as "NA.""

Given the raity of house sales in some counties, filling in zeros for missing variables was deemed appropriate. We avoided adding extra rows, which was the most suitable approach for maintaining the integrity of the dataset.

Here are the key features included in the dataset:

#### Demographic Data

The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, conducted by the
U.S. Census Bureau, provide extensive demographic data on various aspects
of life in U.S. communities. From this source, we obtained county-level
estimates for median income, rental vacancy rates, property taxes, and
the number of housing units per year. Additionally, historical population estimates
for each county were sourced from the Portland State University
Population Research Center. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) user website provided yearly 50th percentile rent
estimates for each county. For our analysis, we utilized the 2-bedroom
rental estimates for each county and year.  Notably, there were no missing data in the U.S. Census 5-year estimate tables, HUD data, or the Portland State University's population Research Center Datasets. 

Here are the key features included in our demographic datasets:

#### Economic Indicator

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis offers a robust collection of
economic data, from which we obtained historical national data on
30-year mortgage rates. Although county or state-level mortgage rate data
was unavailable, we posited that state-level figures would approximate
the national averages, with similar trends observable across the data.  To avoid drawing incorrect conclusions if Oregon's monthly average rate differed significantly, we used this data only to observe general trends in housing payment affordability over time.

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning

Several sources, such as census.gov, provide APIs for data access.
However, we found it more practical to use their table explorer to
download CSV files. The vast number of variables on census.gov
necessitates an advanced search mechanism, including an AI-assisted
search tool that offers intelligent data suggestions based on user
queries. Once the desired table configuration is achieved, the tool can
generate an API call for future data retrieval. Although this feature is
beneficial for obtaining up-to-date data, it was not essential for our
current project.

We encountered a variety of data formats from different sources, which
necessitated significant data cleaning and preparation. A notable
challenge was managing data provided as separate files for each year,
resulting in an extensive number of files for our ten-year study period.
To streamline this process, we concatenated these files, which involved
transposing tables and manual data manipulation. We later automated this
process with a Python script to improve efficiency.

Standardizing county names and removing extraneous characters, such as
dollar signs from prices, were additional tasks required to harmonize
the dataset. Despite these challenges, the data was generally
well-structured. Ultimately, we transformed disparate data 
sources into a cohesive set of CSVs that could be imported into a Postgres 
database.

### Data Storage

These datasets were imported into temporary tables using an SQL script,
facilitating the creation of a comprehensive database through joins
based on county and year.

The final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is
illustrated in the figure below.


![Entity Relationship Diagram](images/data/erd-updated.png){#fig-erd}


The capstone redfin and mortgage tables were straight imports from the cleaned CSVs.
The capstone income_population_housingunits_rent table was created with a series of left joins
starting with the income temporary table, then individually joining the population, 
housingunits, rent, rental_vacancy, and property_tax tables on county and year.

*  redfin table had a date format of yyyy-mm-dd (dates were always first of each month)
*  mortgage table had a date format of yyyy-mm-dd (dates were always first of each month)
*  income_population_housingunits_rent had a date format of yyyy

By joining our resulting tables, we were able to use this database to create the initial dataset, 
output to a CSV file, for our analysis. The resulting dataset was created by joining the tables seen in the ERD.
Starting with the redfin table, we joined the mortgage data on date the columns.  The income_population_housingunits_rent
table was then right joined by year (extracting year from the redfin table date and comparing it to the income_population_housingunits_rent table).


### Feature Engineering

We were able to obtain several features related to affordability,
including current rental prices, national monthly mortgage rates,
and median_sales_prices. These allowed us to create new variables
specifically targeted to affordability. All of these operations were performed
on the dataset defined above in Python, and the resulting features were added to the Pandas dataframe to continue
the analysis.

###### **Reconciling Monthly and Yearly Data**

We noticed unusual patterns when plotting monthly vs yearly data in our
scatter plot graphs, where the data formed clumped columns. This did not seem representative of real-world trends, as a county's median
income does not suddently increase from one year to the next. Many of these variables will change over smaller increments of time. After consulting with our project statistician, Hank
Ibser, he suggested that smoothing the transition of the yearly
variables by taking the average change and cumulatively increasing (or
decreasing) the feature amount over the number of months of county data. This apporach would provide a better way to handle the features than to leave large
jumps from year to year. For the last year of data, since we did not have numbers beyond 2022, we averaged all the previous deltas and applied that as our step up or down, then multiplied that by the number of months of data we had and applied the incremental steps to the original rows. We smoothed out the transitions in this way for the following variables:
`median_income`, `population`, `num_housing_units`, `median_rent_2bdrm`,
and `rental_vacancy`.

Example plots of before and after:

::: {#fig-smoothed layout-ncol=2}

![Before Smoothing](images/before_smoothing.png){#fig-before_smoothing}

![After Smoothing](images/after_smoothing.png){#fig-after_smoothing}

Feature Engineering: Variable Smoothing
:::

These feature transitions were smoothed using the following formula:

For each county, sorted by ascending date, for each year except the last represented:

$$ monthly\_avg = \frac{next\_year\_value - current\_year\_value}{n} $$

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ smoothed\_month\_of\_year = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i\times{(monthly\_avg)} + month\_of\_year $$
:::

For each county, sorted by ascending date, last year of rows:

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ smoothed\_month\_of\_year = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i\times{(avg\_mc)} + month\_of\_year $$
:::

Where:<br> 
<i>n</i> = number of rows of data for the county in a year<br> 
<i>next\_year\_value</i> = the first value of the next year for the feature<br> 
<i>current\_year\_value</i>= the first value of the current year for the feature<br> 
<i>monthly\_avg</i> = average monthly change for the year<br>
<i>avg\_mc</i> = average monthly change for all previous years<br>

###### **Monthly Housing Payment**: `monthly_housing_payment`

We then created a variable to hold the median monthly mortgage payment,
using the following formula (Mortgage Payment Calculator - NerdWallet, 2023) and
validated against the online calculator at the same site:

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ M = .8\times\frac{I(1 + I)^N }{(1 + I)^N − 1} $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>M</i> = `monthly_housing_payment`<br> <i>P</i> =
`median_sale_price`<br> <i>I</i> = `monthly_avg_mortgage_rate`<br>
<i>N</i> = 360 (the number of total payments over 30 years)<br>

We made this calculation based on a 20% down payment and a 30-year fixed
term. This is a big assumption, but gives us a baseline to look at
affordability.

###### **Monthly Median Income**: `monthly_median_income`

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ mmi = \frac{mi}{12} $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>mmi</i> = `monthly_median_income`<br> <i>mi</i> =
`median_income`<br>

###### **Monthly Affordable Housing Payment**: `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`

This feature holds the maximum housing payment considered affordable,
based on the HUD's affordability threshold of 30%.

::: {text-align="center"}
$$ mahp = .3 \times mmi $$
:::

Where:<br> <i>mahp</i> = `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`<br>
<i>mmi</i> = `median_income`<br>

### Data Ethics Statement

This dataset consists of aggregated time series data from various sources, and we acknowledge several ethical considerations and potential biases that users should be aware of:

* Data Aggregation: While aggregation protects individual privacy, it may obscure nuances and potentially introduce biases.
* Missing Data: Our dataset contains gaps due to incomplete reporting or the unavailability of data. We've documented the dataset suffering from incomplete data and discussed how we deal with the situations that arise.
* Availability Bias: Some data sources were inaccessible behind paywalls, which may have introduced an availability bias. Our dataset might over-represent information from sources with more resources or those willing to share data openly. We've attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a diverse range of sources where possible.
* Preprocessing Bias: The data cleaning and normalization procedures we've employed, while necessary for analysis, may have inadvertently emphasized certain patterns or diminished others. We've documented all preprocessing steps to ensure transparency, but we encourage users to critically evaluate how these procedures might impact their specific use cases.
* Time Series Considerations: As a time series dataset, there are potential issues with seasonal biases, trend-related challenges, and autocorrelation. We've documented the full time range of the data and any known external factors that may have influenced the data during specific periods.
* Estimated Data:  Estimations in data are inherently biased.  We have done the best we could with our conclusions and limitations to take into account that much of our data comes from an uncertain collection.
