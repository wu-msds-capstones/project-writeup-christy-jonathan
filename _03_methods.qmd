# Methods

The inputs to housing affordability are complex and, often times, intertwined.

#### Rental vs Home Ownership - An Early Project Decision Point
The aim of this project was to primarily look into unaffordable housing and housing consists, primarily, of 2 kinds
of housed individuals:  those who rent and those who own a home.  To decide if we should be focused on both rental unit prices and current home sales, we looked at the
current affordability strategies and compared them with our data to determine the most immediate need.

##### Evaluation of the current rental situation:
About 33% of Oregonians rent, based on the most up-to-date U.S. Census numbers (Oregon’s Homeownership Rate, n.d.).  We evaluated, `median_rent_2bdrm` vs `monthly_affordable_housing_payment` county-by-county
to assess whether Oregonians are paying an unaffordable amount of rent each month.  You can see in the graph below that rental prices sit comfortably under the maximum affordable threshold.  Becuase of this, we decided to focus
on home sale prices for the rest of our analysis.

#### Project Design

##### Summary

In this study, we sought to identify dataset features associated with a set of researched housing strategies. First, 
we curated a list of relevant features and then narrowed it down by identifying those with the highest percentages of 
housing transactions that show significant linear associations with median sale prices. Next, we fitted linear models 
for each county to assess how these factors influence housing prices and in what direction.

To capture more complex, potentially non-linear relationships, we also employed a random forest machine learning model. 
This allowed us to evaluate the importance of each feature based on our original list of strategies.

These methodologies enable us to determine the most critical factors to focus on, such as increasing the housing supply, 
when formulating housing strategies.  Put simply, you can think of the design as a funnel where each step takes the next
logical progression in finding a set of strategy-associated features that affect the median sale price the most.

##### 2. Research and Identification of Core Strategies - A way to refine the dataset to targeted variables
Given the ultimate goal of this project to identify strategies that can help balance demand with the rising cost of housing, 
we began by conducting a comprehensive review of current strategies addressing housing affordability. This review aimed to 
identify the fundamental objectives of these strategies, such as increasing housing inventory, stabilizing rental prices, 
and enhancing accessibility for low-income households. The result of this review is a list of strategies and their respective 
goals, as detailed below.

To evaluate these strategies in relation to the data we collected, we needed to determine if any of the stated goals were 
directly or indirectly associated with our dataset. Initially, we attempted to make these associations ourselves, but 
recognizing our limitations as non-experts in housing policy, we sought assistance from AI tools. We utilized Anthropic’s 
Claude AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT to analyze our dataset and tag each strategy goal with both direct and indirect associations 
to the dataset features. We found the intersecting sets of features curated from their responses were close in size to our original set.   
We therefore went forward with our analysis using this newly curated set. This approach also served as a validation step, 
ensuring that we had obtained some of the necessary data for the project.

For creating the AI prompt, we uploaded a CSV containing all data from our PostgreSQL database, a markdown file with the complete data dictionary, and a list of strategies and goals. The prompt used for the AI analysis was as follows:

"Using the attached dataset and data_dictionary.md data dictionary, identify direct and indirect associations between the strategy goals and the dataset features."

##### 3. Data Exploration and Initial Analysis 

###### **Handling Different Types of Data and Choosing an Analysis Dataset**

We have several kinds of features in our dataset at this point:

* Data sourced through public websites
* Engineered Features
* Smoothed yearly data

When and how we use this data is an important aspect in our analysis and results.  We found our engineered features to be
very useful for determining trends and identifying when pricing became unaffordable, but those features were created
directly from other features in the set, obfuscating the raw data as indicators of housing prices.  We briefly left those
features in and found their significant correlation with the raw features to be detracting from getting a base-level 
understanding of what affects housing pricing.

Another important piece of our data is its time series aspect.  For Linear Regression analysis and the Random Forest model,
this data dimension is removed so that we can focus on what features correlate to housing prices, regardless of time.

After the analysis of the strategy list tagged with feature names, we chose a feature set to move forward and further
refine using various kinds of correlation.

###### **Handling Missing Data**

A review of our dataset revealed missing data in the following features: `new_listings`, `inventory`,  `days_on_market`, and `average_sale_to_list`.

A deeper inspection shows these values missing in the more sparsely Oregon counties, where home sales do not necessarily happen every month.  To handle
these, we decided to fill these with 0 values rather than drop the entire row.

In these sparsely populated counties, there are also fewer rows of home sales due to the fact that there are so few homes that sell in these areas.

##### 4. Identification of Significant Features 

###### **Correlation Studies**

Correlation studies gather evidence of association between our feature list and the median house pricing.  In this section, we look at
scatter plots, trend analysis, and linear regression exploration of each county in Oregon.

* **Scatter Plots**

Since the dataset is sectioned into counties, looking at scatter plots makes most sense when aggregating by counties.  Patterns
of correlation start to emerge when looking at county-aggregated cross-sections of the dataset.

Using Pairplot from the Seaborn library, we looked at bivariate scatter plots on the aggregated cross-sections to determine variable associations.  These
plots give an indications of whether linear regression could be a good first model.

* **Trend Analysis** 

All of our gathered data is time-series data.  It is important to explore the associated temporal trends in the data to identify 
what indicators of our feature set are significant and in what direction they are trending.  We used the Mann-Kendall seasonality
test to measure these trends by county for each feature in our feature set with an association to median sale price.

* **Linregress, a quick fit to measure significance**

We analyzed 36 counties in our dataset to identify which features have a significant association with the highest number 
of homes sold in Oregon. We developed an algorithm that uses the linregress from the SciPy Stats library and calculates 
the sum of the percentages of homes sold in each county where a feature is significant. For example, Washington County 
accounts for about 15% of all homes sold in Oregon during the period covered by our dataset. If a feature is only significant 
in Washington County, its representation among all homes sold in Oregon would be 15%. We set a p-value threshold of 0.05 for 
significance and required that significant features be present in at least 90% of home sales to be considered. See @fig-feature-sig below for more details.

![Feature Significance Representation in Oregon Home Sales](images/feature_significance.drawio.png){#fig-feature-sig width=300}

This further refined the set of features that we will consider for a multiple linear regression model.

* **Testing For Multicollinearity**

One thing that might cause a regression analysis to show better than expected results is when the independent features are not so independent with each other.
Using variance_inflation_factor (VIF) from the Statsmodels library, we were able to try all combinations of our remaining variables to find viable candidate
combinations to fit a linear model.  Using a threshold VIF of 10, we narrowed usable combinations of features that could be used together for multiple 
linear regression.  To ensure we went forward with an appropriate set of features, we ran this analysis on the most and least populated counties.

##### 5. Building a Linear Regression Model

Our previous analysis yielded a subset of feature combinations suitable for fitting a linear model. The subset was manageable enough to fit a linear 
regression model to all combinations, create train and test datasets with a 70%/30% split, and use Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression library to evaluate each combination's performance. 
Identifying models with a good fit allowed us to determine the associated features and compare them against our random forest model. During this process, we also applied the Anderson-Darling 
test to ensure that the residuals followed a normal distribution, which is necessary for evaluating the model’s fit. A p-value less than 0.05 in the Anderson-Darling 
test indicated that the residuals were not normally distributed for that combination of features. Linear regression is a valuable tool for understanding the magnitude 
and direction of a feature’s impact on the target variable.  We noted that the models fit differently between densely populated counties and sparsely populated counties.  We took a representative
of each kind of county to represent how the model fit.  For each model fit, we measured the following values:

* R-squared
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* Max Error
* Mean Squared Log Error
* Median Absolute Error
* Mean Poisson Deviance

##### 6. Building a Random Forest Model

Random Forest ML models are useful to capture more of the feature effects on a target variable than linear regression can accomplish.  Therefore, it is worth
fitting a Random Forest Regressor model.  We used a 2-step approach, first fitting the model to all strategy-tagged features, then checked for feature importance
to find the features that contribute the most to the model, then re-running the model with the most important features.  
We used Scikit-learn's RandomForest library to train and test the dataset.  We next employed the 
`permutation_importance` function from the `sklearn` library to ascertain the importance of various features. 
A Random Forest Regressor model was constructed and evaluated to validate these findings.  For each county we measured the following values:

* R-squared
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* Max Error
* Mean Squared Log Error
* Median Absolute Error
* Mean Poisson Deviance
* Mean Gamma Deviance

We were then ready to compare and contrast our feature findings.
