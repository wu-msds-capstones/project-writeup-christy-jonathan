<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The right to housing is recognized worldwide in numerous human rights legal documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948. However, in recent years access to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the United States. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that the lack of affordable housing costs the American economy approximately $2 trillion annually in lost wages and productivity (NLIHC, 2022).<br>
Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include rapid population growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow.</p>

<p>Oregon, in particular, is experiencing a profound housing crisis characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing demand for housing and the availability of affordable housing options. As the state’s population grows, particularly in urban centers such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, the pressure on the housing market has intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates. This trend has created significant challenges for low- and middle-income families, who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of this issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to affordable housing and the development of effective strategies to address them.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Oregon is currently grappling with a significant housing crisis marked by a mismatch between the growing demand for housing and the availability of affordable housing options. This crisis has been exacerbated by a combination of rapid population growth, economic factors, and regulatory constraints. Understanding and addressing the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon is essential for developing effective strategies that can balance housing demand with affordability.</p>
<section id="population-growth-and-housing-demand" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population-growth-and-housing-demand">Population Growth and Housing Demand</h4>
<p>Oregon’s population has been growing steadily over the past decade. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the state experienced a population increase of approximately 10.6% from 2010 to 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). This growth has been concentrated in urban areas such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, leading to increased demand for housing in these regions. As more people move to these urban centers for job opportunities and quality of life, the pressure on the housing market intensifies, driving up home prices and rental rates.</p>
</section>
<section id="economic-factors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-factors">Economic Factors</h4>
<p>The economic landscape in Oregon has also contributed to the housing affordability crisis. Rising construction costs, driven by increasing prices for labor and materials, have made it more expensive to build new housing units (National Association of Home Builders, 2021). Additionally, land prices in desirable urban areas have surged, further compounding the cost of housing development (Glaeser &amp; Gyourko, 2018). These economic factors create significant barriers for developers seeking to build affordable housing.</p>
</section>
<section id="regulatory-and-policy-barriers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regulatory-and-policy-barriers">Regulatory and Policy Barriers</h4>
<p>Regulatory constraints, such as zoning laws and land use regulations, play a critical role in shaping the housing market in Oregon. Urban growth boundaries, while designed to prevent urban sprawl and protect natural landscapes, have limited the availability of developable land, thereby increasing housing costs (Phillips &amp; Goodstein, 2000). Furthermore, restrictive zoning laws often favor single-family homes over higher-density developments, reducing the potential supply of affordable housing options (Pendall, 2020).</p>
</section>
<section id="strategies-to-address-housing-affordability" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategies-to-address-housing-affordability">Strategies to Address Housing Affordability</h4>
<p>Various strategies have been proposed and implemented in Oregon to address the housing affordability crisis. Inclusionary zoning policies, for example, require or incentivize developers to include affordable units in new residential projects. The City of Portland has adopted such policies, aiming to increase the availability of affordable housing within new developments (City of Portland, 2017).</p>
<p>State-level legislation, such as Oregon’s House Bill 2001, seeks to promote higher-density housing by allowing the construction of duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in areas previously zoned for single-family homes (Oregon Legislature, 2019). This approach is intended to increase the housing supply and provide more affordable options.</p>
<p>Public-private partnerships are another critical strategy, leveraging public funds and private sector expertise to finance and build affordable housing projects. For instance, the Portland Housing Bond, a voter-approved initiative, aims to create 1,300 new affordable housing units in the city (City of Portland, 2021).</p>
<p>Innovative construction methods, including modular and prefabricated housing, offer potential solutions to reduce construction costs and increase the speed of housing production. These methods are being explored in Oregon as a way to address the housing shortage more effectively (Smith, 2021).</p>

<section id="research-objectives" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-objectives">Research Objectives</h4>
<p>This study aims to explore the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various economic and demographic factors and comparing those to key strategies that are used around the world to tackle housing affordability. By identifying some key factors that influence affordability, the study seeks to provide some insight for policymakers, developers, and community stakeholders into what strategies hold some promise at taming the affordability crisis.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<section id="project-data-ideation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-data-ideation">Project Data Ideation</h3>
<p>In this section, we address the significant lack of publicly available housing data, which has posed considerable challenges for our research. Although we successfully integrated ten years of Redfin data with demographic and economic indicators, there remain several critical data points we were unable to obtain. Notably, data extending beyond ten years, historical land prices, construction costs, and timelines for housing development were inaccessible. These gaps represent missed opportunities that could have enhanced the comprehensiveness of our dataset.</p>
<p>During our literature review, we compiled a list of desired data features and attempted to locate them online. However, our searches frequently reached a dead end, especially on state websites. While Oregon provides data through PDF reports, there is no user-friendly repository, such as downloadable CSV files or APIs, offering access to extensive historical data. This limitation hindered our ability to create a more robust dataset for our analysis.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-acquisition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-acquisition">Data Acquisition</h3>
<p>The acquisition of housing data proved challenging, particularly due to the restrictive nature of companies like Zillow in sharing their data. Consequently, we turned to Redfin, which offered the most comprehensive data on house sales. To augment our dataset and incorporate the “affordability” aspect of our research, we included national mortgage rates, median income, population, and estimated housing units per county.</p>
<p>Several sources, such as census.gov, provide APIs for data access. However, we found it more practical to use their table explorer to download CSV files. The sheer volume of variables on census.gov necessitates an advanced search mechanism, including an AI-assisted search tool that offers intelligent data suggestions based on user queries. Once the desired table configuration is achieved, the tool can generate an API call for future data retrieval. Although this feature is beneficial for obtaining up-to-date data, it was not essential for our current project.</p>
<p>We encountered a variety of data formats from different sources, which necessitated significant data cleaning and preparation. A notable challenge was managing data provided as separate files for each year, resulting in an extensive number of files for our ten-year study period. To streamline this process, we concatenated these files, which involved transposing tables and manual data manipulation. We later automated this process with a Python script to make it more efficient.</p>
<p>Standardizing county names and removing extraneous characters, such as dollar signs from prices, were additional tasks required to harmonize the dataset. Despite these challenges, the data was generally well-structured. The final dataset, categorized by the level of temporal and geographical granularity, is detailed in the <a href="capstone.html#data-dictionary">Data Dictionary</a> below. This structured approach facilitated the integration of diverse data sources into a cohesive Postgres database, enabling a thorough analysis of housing affordability in Oregon.</p>
<section id="data-sources" class="level4">

<section id="housing-data---redfin-data-center" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-data---redfin-data-center">Housing Data - Redfin Data Center</h6>
<p>Redfin provides a comprehensive dataset accessible through its data center, offering both graphical representations and downloadable files. The dataset spans from 2012 to the present and allows for geographic filtering specific to Oregon counties. We extracted data for all available years, encompassing all property types, and used raw values rather than year-over-year comparisons or seasonally adjusted figures.</p>
</section>
<section id="demographic-data" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demographic-data">Demographic Data</h6>
<ul>
<li>The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, offer extensive demographic data on various aspects of life in U.S. communities. From this source, we obtained county-level estimates for median income, rental vacancy rates, property taxes, and the number of housing units per year.</li>
<li>Historical population estimates for each county were sourced from the Portland State University Population Research Center.</li>
<li>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) user website provided yearly 50th percentile rent estimates for each county. For our analysis, we utilized the 2-bedroom rental estimates for each county and year.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="economic-indicator" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-indicator">Economic Indicator</h6>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of St.&nbsp;Louis offers a robust collection of economic data, from which we obtained historical national data on 30-year mortgage rates. While county or state-level mortgage rate data was unavailable, we posited that state-level figures would approximate the national averages, with similar trends observable across the data.</p>
<p>By integrating these diverse datasets, our research aims to comprehensively examine housing affordability trends in Oregon, leveraging detailed demographic and economic indicators to provide a nuanced analysis.</p>

7.  Median Rental Prices for a 2-Bedroom Unit
8.  Redfin Housing Data</code></pre>
<p>These datasets were imported into temporary tables using an SQL script, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive database through joins based on county and year. The final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<p>By joining our resulting tables, were able to use this database to create the initial dataset, output to a CSV file, to use for our analysis.</p>

<p>We were able to obtain a number of features related to affordability, including current rental prices, national monthly mortgage rates, median_sales_prices. These allowed us to create new variables specifically targeted to affordability.</p>
<section id="reconciling-monthly-and-yearly-data" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reconciling-monthly-and-yearly-data"><strong>Reconciling Monthly and Yearly Data</strong></h6>
<p>We noticed odd things when we plotted monthly vs yearly data in our scatter plot graphs. Our data took on clumped column shapes. And it did not seem representative of what happens in reality. A county’s median income does not suddently increase from one year to the next, for example. Many of these variables will be different over smaller increments of time. While consulting with our project statistician, Hank Ibser, he suggested that smoothing the transition of the yearly variables by taking the average change and cumulatively increasing (or decreasing) the feature amount over the number of months of county data would be a better way to deal with the features than to leave large jumps from year to year. This left the question of what to do with the last year of data, since we do not have numbers beyond 2022. We decided to average all of the previous deltas and apply that as our step up or down, then proceeded to multiply that by the number of months of data we had and apply the incremental steps to the original rows. We smoothed out the transitions in this way for the following variables: <code>median_income</code>, <code>population</code>, <code>num_housing_units</code>, <code>median_rent_2bdrm</code>, and <code>rental_vacancy</code>.</p>
<p>These feature transitions were smoothed using the following formula:</p>
If year &lt; 2022:
<div data-text-align="center">
<span class="math display">\[ mc = \frac{nyv - cyv}{n} \]</span>
</div>
<div data-text-align="center">
<span class="math display">\[ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i{(mc)} \]</span>
</div>
<p>fix this so it explains the anyv</p>
If year = 2022:
<div data-text-align="center">
<span class="math display">\[ amc = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{j}{mc}}{j} \]</span>
</div>
<div data-text-align="center">
<span class="math display">\[ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}i{(mc)} \]</span>
</div>
<p>Where:<br> <i>n</i> = number of rows of data for the county in a year<br> <i>nyv</i> = the next year value for the feature<br> <i>cyv</i> = current year value for the feature<br> <i>mc</i> = change per 1 month<br> <i>amc</i> = average month changes for all previous years<br> <i>j</i> = the number of monthly changes (mc) we calculated for previous years<br> <i>anyv</i> = average of the all year averages<br></p>

<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monthly-housing-payment-monthly_housing_payment"><strong>Monthly Housing Payment</strong>: <code>monthly_housing_payment</code></h6>
<p>We then created a variable to hold the median monthly mortgage payment, using the following formula:</p>
<div data-text-align="center">
<span class="math display">\[ M = .8P \frac{I(1 + I)^N }{(1 + I)^N − 1} \]</span>
</div>
<p>Where:<br> <i>M</i> = <code>monthly_housing_payment</code><br> <i>P</i> = <code>median_sale_price</code><br> <i>I</i> = <code>monthly_avg_mortgage_rate</code><br> <i>N</i> = 360 (the number of total payments over 30 years)<br></p>
<p>We made this calculation based on a 20% down payment and a 30-year fixed term. This is a big assumption, but gives us a baseline to look at affordability.</p>

<p>The inputs to housing affordability are complex and, often times, intertwined.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rental-vs-home-ownership---an-early-project-decision-point">Rental vs Home Ownership - An Early Project Decision Point</h4>
<p>The aim of this project was to primarily look into unaffordable housing and housing consists, primarily, of 2 kinds of housed individuals: those who rent and those who own a home. To decide if we should be focused on both rental unit prices and current home sales, we looked at the current affordability strategies and compared them with our data to determine the most immediate need.</p>
<section id="evaluation-of-the-current-rental-situation" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation-of-the-current-rental-situation">Evaluation of the current rental situation:</h5>
<p>About 33% of Oregonians rent, based on the most up-to-date U.S. Census numbers (Oregon’s Homeownership Rate, n.d.). We evaluated, <code>median_rent_2bdrm</code> vs <code>monthly_affordable_housing_payment</code> county-by-county to assess whether Oregonians are paying an unaffordable amount of rent each month. You can see in the graph below that rental prices sit comfortably under the maximum affordable threshold. Becuase of this, we decided to focus on home sale prices for the rest of our analysis. <br><br><br></p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>In this study, we sought to identify dataset features associated with a set of researched housing strategies. First, we curated a list of relevant features and then narrowed it down by identifying those with the highest percentages of housing transactions that show significant linear associations with median sale prices. Next, we fitted linear models for each county to assess how these factors influence housing prices and in what direction.</p>
<p>To capture more complex, potentially non-linear relationships, we also employed a random forest machine learning model. This allowed us to evaluate the importance of each feature based on our original list of strategies.</p>
<p>These methodologies enable us to determine the most critical factors to focus on, such as increasing the housing supply, when formulating housing strategies. Put simply, you can think of the design as a funnel where each step takes the next logical progression in finding a set of strategy-associated features that affect the median sale price the most.</p>

<h5 class="anchored">2. Research and Identification of Core Strategies - A way to refine the dataset to targeted variables</h5>
<p>Given the ultimate goal of this project to identify strategies that can help balance demand with the rising cost of housing, we began by conducting a comprehensive review of current strategies addressing housing affordability. This review aimed to identify the fundamental objectives of these strategies, such as increasing housing inventory, stabilizing rental prices, and enhancing accessibility for low-income households. The result of this review is a list of strategies and their respective goals, as detailed below.</p>
<p>To evaluate these strategies in relation to the data we collected, we needed to determine if any of the stated goals were directly or indirectly associated with our dataset. Initially, we attempted to make these associations ourselves, but recognizing our limitations as non-experts in housing policy, we sought assistance from AI tools. We utilized Anthropic’s Claude AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT to analyze our dataset and tag each strategy goal with both direct and indirect associations to the dataset features. We found the intersecting sets of features curated from their responses were close in size to our original set.<br>
We therefore went forward with our analysis using this newly curated set. This approach also served as a validation step, ensuring that we had obtained some of the necessary data for the project.</p>
<p>For creating the AI prompt, we uploaded a CSV containing all data from our PostgreSQL database, a markdown file with the complete data dictionary, and a list of strategies and goals. The prompt used for the AI analysis was as follows:</p>
<p>“Using the attached dataset and data_dictionary.md data dictionary, identify direct and indirect associations between the strategy goals and the dataset features.”</p>

<p>We have several kinds of features in our dataset at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data sourced through public websites</li>
<li>Engineered Features</li>
<li>Smoothed yearly data</li>
</ul>
<p>When and how we use this data is an important aspect in our analysis and results. We found our engineered features to be very useful for determining trends and identifying when pricing became unaffordable, but those features were created directly from other features in the set, obfuscating the raw data as indicators of housing prices. We briefly left those features in and found their significant correlation with the raw features to be detracting from getting a base-level understanding of what affects housing pricing.</p>
<p>Another important piece of our data is its time series aspect. For Linear Regression analysis and the Random Forest model, this data dimension is removed so that we can focus on what features correlate to housing prices, regardless of time.</p>
<p>After the analysis of the strategy list tagged with feature names, we chose a feature set to move forward and further refine using various kinds of correlation.</p>
</section>
<section id="handling-missing-data" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="handling-missing-data"><strong>Handling Missing Data</strong></h6>
<p>A review of our dataset revealed missing data in the following features: <code>new_listings</code>, <code>inventory</code>, <code>days_on_market</code>, and <code>average_sale_to_list</code>.</p>
<p>A deeper inspection shows these values missing in the more sparsely Oregon counties, where home sales do not necessarily happen every month. To handle these, we decided to fill these with 0 values rather than drop the entire row.</p>
<p>In these sparsely populated counties, there are also fewer rows of home sales due to the fact that there are so few homes that sell in these areas.</p>

<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-studies"><strong>Correlation Studies</strong></h6>
<p>Correlation studies gather evidence of association between our feature list and the median house pricing. In this section, we look at scatter plots, trend analysis, and linear regression exploration of each county in Oregon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scatter Plots</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the dataset is sectioned into counties, looking at scatter plots makes most sense when aggregating by counties. Patterns of correlation start to emerge when looking at county-aggregated cross-sections of the dataset.</p>
<p>Using Pairplot from the Seaborn library, we looked at bivariate scatter plots on the aggregated cross-sections to determine variable associations. These plots give an indications of whether linear regression could be a good first model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trend Analysis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All of our gathered data is time-series data. It is important to explore the associated temporal trends in the data to identify what indicators of our feature set are significant and in what direction they are trending. We used the Mann-Kendall seasonality test to measure these trends by county for each feature in our feature set with an association to median sale price.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linregress, a quick fit to measure significance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We analyzed 36 counties in our dataset to identify which features have a significant association with the highest number of homes sold in Oregon. We developed an algorithm that uses the linregress from the SciPy Stats library and calculates the sum of the percentages of homes sold in each county where a feature is significant. For example, Washington County accounts for about 15% of all homes sold in Oregon during the period covered by our dataset. If a feature is only significant in Washington County, its representation among all homes sold in Oregon would be 15%. We set a p-value threshold of 0.05 for significance and required that significant features be present in at least 90% of home sales to be considered. See <a href="#fig-feature-sig" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a> below for more details.</p>

<p>This further refined the set of features that we will consider for a multiple linear regression model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing For Multicollinearity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One potential factor that may lead to unexpectedly favorable results in a regression analysis is the presence of multicollinearity among the independent variables. To address this issue, we utilized the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) from the Statsmodels library to evaluate all possible combinations of our remaining variables. By applying a VIF threshold of 10, we were able to identify viable sets of features suitable for inclusion in a multiple linear regression model. To ensure the robustness of our feature selection, we conducted this analysis on both the most and least populated counties.</p>

<section id="building-a-linear-regression-model" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-linear-regression-model">5. Building a Linear Regression Model</h5>
<p>Our prior analysis identified a subset of feature combinations suitable for fitting a linear regression model. This subset was sufficiently manageable to allow us to fit linear regression models to all combinations. We then created training and testing datasets with a 70%/30% split and utilized Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression library to evaluate the performance of each combination.</p>
<p>By identifying models with a good fit, we were able to determine the relevant features and compare them with our random forest model. To ensure the validity of our models, we applied the Anderson-Darling test to verify that the residuals followed a normal distribution, which is crucial for evaluating the model’s fit. A p-value less than 0.05 in the Anderson-Darling test indicated that the residuals were not normally distributed for that particular combination of features.</p>
<p>Linear regression is an essential tool for understanding the magnitude and direction of a feature’s impact on the target variable. Our analysis revealed differences in model fit between densely populated and sparsely populated counties. We selected a representative county from each category to illustrate these differences. For each model fit, we measured the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>R-squared</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</li>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
<li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</li>
<li>Max Error</li>

<li>Median Absolute Error</li>
<li>Mean Poisson Deviance</li>

<section id="building-a-random-forest-model" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-random-forest-model">6. Building a Random Forest Model</h5>
<p>Random Forest machine learning models are advantageous for capturing the effects of features on a target variable more comprehensively than linear regression. Therefore, fitting a Random Forest Regressor model is beneficial. We employed a two-step approach: initially fitting the model to all strategy-tagged features and subsequently assessing feature importance to identify the most significant contributors. The model was then re-run using these key features.</p>
<p>We utilized Scikit-learn’s RandomForest library to train and test the dataset. Additionally, we employed the permutation_importance function from the sklearn library to determine the importance of various features. A Random Forest Regressor model was constructed and evaluated to validate these findings. For each county, we measured the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>R-squared</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</li>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
<li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</li>

<li>Mean Squared Log Error</li>
<li>Median Absolute Error</li>
<li>Mean Poisson Deviance</li>
<li>Mean Gamma Deviance</li>

<p>Using the analysis of the strategy-tagged features above, we moved forward with the following set of indicators to analyze:</p>
<p>independent variables = <code>new_listings</code>, <code>inventory</code>, <code>num_housing_units</code>, <code>median_income</code>, <code>population</code>, <code>property_tax</code>, <code>homes_sold</code>, <code>days_on_market</code></p>
<p>dependent variable = <code>median_sale_price</code></p>
<p><strong>Scatter Plot Samples</strong></p>
<p>What we found early on in the analysis was that there is a big difference in how features respond to <code>median_sale_prices</code> depending on the county density. For example, the following scatter plot clusters are from Washington and Wheeler Counties. This is a trend that will show up all through the analysis.</p>

<li>Regression fits well to densely populated counties with a median_sale_price target.</li>
<li>Sparsely populated counties are best modeled by their median rental prices.</li>

<p>Plain Linear Regression:</p>
<p>[‘num_housing_units’, ‘days_on_market’, ‘inventory’] R^2: 0.9550268107703429, MAE: 18.991051374287636, RMSE: 24.584835761694823 Using the Anderson-Darling test for normal distribution p-value from the test - below 0.05 generally means non-normal: 0.060124359532653535 Residuals are normally distributed [[86.72340057 -7.53914015 0.23939715]]</p>
<p>This value 86.72 is a strong indicator that if you increase housing units, median house prices will rise. This is surprising given that a lot of the focus is on building more housing at a faster pace. What’s up with this? Does it hold true for other counties?</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Our results depend on what kind of counties we are looking at. Sparsely populated county home sales are mostly land sales and not at all like the dynamics seen in densely populated counties. A one-fit model is inadequate to cover all Oregon counties.</p>
<p>However, these sparsely populated counties also do not</p>
