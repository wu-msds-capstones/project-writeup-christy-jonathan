# Introduction

The right to housing is recognized worldwide and included in human
rights legal documents (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019), including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948.
However, in recent years access to affordable housing has become a major
obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the United
States (Hitting Home: Housing Affordability in the U.S. | Econofact, 2024).
The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that the lack of
affordable housing costs the American economy approximately 2 trillion dollars
annually in lost wages and productivity (NLIHC, 2022).


Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years
that include the underproduction of homes, rapid population growth, strict land use laws, land prices,
neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique issues
caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and
permit fees, many states have seen housing affordability dwindle and
homelessness grow.  Oregon, in particular, is experiencing a profound housing crisis
characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing demand for
housing, and the availability of affordable housing options. As the
stateâ€™s population grows, particularly in urban centers such as
Portland, Eugene, and Bend, the pressure on the housing market has
intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates (Ramakrishnan, 2022). As you can see in
@fig-price-increase below, the median sale price increase for a home in Oregon has outpaced the median income between 2013 and 2023. 
This trend has created significant challenges for low- and middle-income families,
who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of
this issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to
affordable housing and the development of effective strategies to
address them.  This study aims to explore the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various economic 
and demographic factors and comparing those to key strategies that are used around the world to tackle housing affordability.
