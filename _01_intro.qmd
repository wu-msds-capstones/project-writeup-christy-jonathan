# Introduction

The right to housing is recognized worldwide in numerous human rights legal documents, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948.  However, in recent years access
to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the
United States.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “Research shows that
the shortage of affordable housing costs the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower
wages and productivity.”  Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include rapid population
growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique
issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have
seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow.

Oregon is experiencing a profound housing crisis characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing
demand for housing and the availability of affordable housing options. As the state’s population grows,
particularly in urban centers such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, the pressure on the housing market has
intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates. This trend has created significant challenges for
low- and middle-income families, who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of this
issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to affordable housing and the development of effective
strategies to address them.
