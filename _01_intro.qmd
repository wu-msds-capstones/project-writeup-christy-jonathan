# Introduction

The right to housing is recognized worldwide and included in human
rights legal documents, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948 (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019).
However, in recent years, access to affordable housing has become a significant
obstacle to homeownership and affordable rent across the United
States (Hitting Home: Housing Affordability in the U.S. | Econofact, 2024).
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the lack of
affordable housing costs the American economy approximately $2 trillion dollars
annually in lost wages and productivity (NLIHC, 2022).


Over the past 20 years, a variety of interconnected factors including the underproduction of homes, rapid population growth, strict land use laws, land prices,
neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased construction costs and
permit fees-have led to a decline in housing affordability and rise in homelessness in many states.   

Oregon, in particular, is experiencing a profound housing crisis
characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing demand for
housing, and the availability of affordable housing options. As the
stateâ€™s population grows, particularly in urban centers such as
Portland, Eugene, and Bend, pressure on the housing market has
intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates (Ramakrishnan, 2022). As shown in
@fig-price-increase below, the median sale price increase for homes in Oregon has outpaced the median income growth between 2013 and 2023. 
This trend has created significant challenges for low- and middle-income families,
who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of
this issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to
affordable housing and the development of effective strategies to
address them.  This study aims to explore the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various economic 
and demographic factors and comparing those to key strategies that are used around the world to tackle housing affordability.
