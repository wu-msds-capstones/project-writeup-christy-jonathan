### Database features removed from analysis:

* `property_tax`<br>
While working on correlations in the data, we noticed how strongly property_tax was correlated to median house sale price.
In digging into why, we realized that property tax is directly calculated on the property value, which is assessed yearly and when a house is sold.
It is, therefore, also correlated to several other predictor variables in the dataset.  We decided to remove this variable from the analysis because it did not provide insight or value to attempting to get at features that might more directly affect median sale price.
