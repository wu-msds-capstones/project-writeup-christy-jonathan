    "text": "The right to housing is recognized worldwide and included in human rights legal documents ((Wikipedia Contributors, 2019), including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948. However, in recent years access to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the United States (Hitting Home: Housing Affordability in the U.S. | Econofact, 2024). The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that the lack of affordable housing costs the American economy approximately 2 trillion dollars annually in lost wages and productivity (NLIHC, 2022).\nDue to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include the underproduction of homes, rapid population growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow. Oregon, in particular, is experiencing a profound housing crisis characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing demand for housing, and the availability of affordable housing options. As the state’s population grows, particularly in urban centers such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, the pressure on the housing market has intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates (Ramakrishnan, 2022). As you can see in Figure 1 below, the median sale price increase for a home in Oregon has outpaced the median income between 2013 and 2023. This trend has created significant challenges for low- and middle-income families, who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of this issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to affordable housing and the development of effective strategies to address them. This study aims to explore the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various economic and demographic factors and comparing those to key strategies that are used around the world to tackle housing affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Median Home Price Increase Outpaces Median Income in Oregon"

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nBy first plotting random bivariate scatter plots for different features of interest against median house sale price, we began to notice there were differences in both the strength of the correlations and their direction (negatively vs positively correlated). We did some research into home sales in the counties where the correlations fell apart and noticed that many of the home sales in these counties, which were sparsely populated, were mostly valued for the land the house structure was on and not for the housing unit itself. Our first order of business was to determine if we needed to look at a subset of counties and, if so, how to determine that subset. We used data exploration to try to help us understand our data.\n\nCorrelation Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Sherman County 3rd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Baker County 25th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Clatsop County 50th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Yamhill County 75th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Multnomah County 100th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Scatter Plots over Stratified by Population Percentile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Correlation Matrix of All Features vs Median Sale Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: median_sale_price_correlation_subset.png\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend Analysis\nTrends can also show us where housing payments began to become unaffordable, like in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 8: Median Mortgage Principal and Interest Payments vs Maximum Affordable Housing Price"
